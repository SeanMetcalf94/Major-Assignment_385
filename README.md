# Major-Assignment_385
This is the project i made as my final project for CMPO385

The program requires access to a microphone to work.
The program will automatically record and play back audio.

There is also a master record that you can start/stop yourself which records all output audio within the program.

The save function will save as "InputAudio" to your default folder.
